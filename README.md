# Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing - PiSA Farmacéutica

This repository presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Anomaly Detection** project for PiSA Farmacéutica. The study focuses on detecting critical anomalies in temperature variables recorded from a blow molding machine used in the production of Electrolit serum bottles. These findings aim to support **predictive maintenance strategies** and extend the operational life of the equipment.

## 📝 Project Overview

The blow molding machine at PiSA Farmacéutica has experienced premature wear and failure, operating only **2-3 months** before requiring major maintenance, far below the expected **1-year** lifespan. Through this project, we analyzed temperature-related data from over **100 sensors**, applied anomaly detection algorithms, and validated our findings using **SARIMA time series forecasting models**.

The analysis confirms that **thermal stress**, as evidenced by anomalous fluctuations in key temperature variables, contributes to the accelerated deterioration of the machine.

## 📊 Main Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on large-scale industrial datasets.
- Apply **Anomaly Detection** using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and PyOD.
- Validate anomalies and predict variable behavior with **SARIMA** forecasting models.
- Provide actionable insights for **predictive maintenance**.

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Data sourced from over 100 sensors.
- Files analyzed: **November 2024** and **January 2025** datasets (~1.8GB each).
- Data structured in Parquet format; processed in **chunks** of 100,000 records to manage memory.
- Pivoted data for easier time series analysis and selected the top **temperature-related** variables based on data coverage.

### 2. Anomaly Detection
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm implemented using **PyOD**.
- Time series smoothed with a **10-observation moving average**.
- Parameters:
  - `n_neighbors = 20`
  - `contamination = 0.0025` (0.25% of data assumed anomalous)

### 3. Forecasting & Validation
- **SARIMA** models applied to three key variables:
  - `energyPerPreform_CurrentPreformNeckFinishTemperature.0`
  - `powerPerPreform_CurrentPreformNeckFinishTemperature.0`
  - `numberOfActivatedRadiators_CurrentPreformNeckFinishTemperature.0`
- Sampling interval adjusted to **10 seconds** to reduce computational load.
- Model validated with **ADF**, **ACF**, **PACF** tests.
- Evaluation metrics: **MAE** and **RMSE**.
